The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n\nThe best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n\nYou may also want to implement:\n- spell-checking for a concrete language - Russian, Tatar, etc. - any one you know, such that the solution accounts for language specifics,\n- some recent (or not very recent) paper on this topic,\n- solution which takes into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings,\n- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster,\n- any other idea of yours to improve the Norvigâ€™s solution.\n\nIMPORTANT:  \nYour project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere.

This dataset was chosen because it provides the necessary n-gram frequencies required for building the language model. Moreover, I tried the Wikipedia Bigrams dataset, but it performed poorly. Therefore, I opted to stick with `bigrams.txt`.\n\n\n2. **Word Skip**:\n   - If a word is known by the spell checker, it will be skipped because it is already correctly spelled. We don't want to fix words that are correct according to their frequency.\n\n\n3. **Incorporation of Laplace Smoothing**:\n   - Laplace smoothing (add-one smoothing) was employed in computing n-gram probabilities to handle unseen n-grams in the dataset. This helps avoid zero probabilities for unseen n-grams and ensures that every n-gram has a non-zero probability.\n\n\n4. **Beam Search Parameters**:\n   - Beam search is not explicitly utilized. However, a form of beam search is implicitly performed when selecting the most probable correction for each word. Instead of exhaustively considering all possible combinations of corrections, I considered a subset of the most probable corrections based on the n-gram probabilities. This approach reduces computational complexity while still aiming to find a reasonable correction for the input sentence.","metadata":{"id":"6Xb_twOmVsC6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Evaluate on a test set\n\nYour task is to generate a test set and evaluate your work.
